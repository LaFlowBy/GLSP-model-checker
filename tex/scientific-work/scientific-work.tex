  \section{Motivation and introduction}
  \label{sec:motivation}

  In software engineering, often \ac{mde} is used to increase development productivity and quality. Concepts are modeled closer to the domain, so that they describe important aspects of a solution with human-friendly abstractions. The models can also be used to generate application fragments, that can be directly used as source code. In the process of \ac{mde}, many activities need to transform source models into different target models, while following a set of transformation rules. This model transformation process is based on algebraic graph transformations. A metamodel is used to model the structure and rules of the concept. The resulting transformation language can provide automatic model creation, development and maintenance activities. \cite{transformations-modeldriven} One framework to use \ac{mde} is \ac{emf} by the Eclipse Foundation. It provides a basis for application development, using modeling and code generation facilities. Much frameworks build upon \ac{emf}, providing various \ac{mde} tools like code generators, graphical diagramming, model transformation or model validation. \cite{emf} One model transformation framework is Henshin. \cite{henshin-repo} It tries to provides model transformation capabilites with a high level of usability. \cite{henshin-usability} For metamodels it uses \ac{emf} Ecore files and for instance models \ac{emf} XMI files. The framework enables transformations on XMI instance files with a defined transformation language. It provides a graphical and textual syntax to create these transformation rules. \cite{henshin-repo} Henshin can be used as a eclipse plugin. Eclipse makes it easy to access, but especially for new users, the heavy editor makes the use of Henshin unintuitive.

  Therefore the goal exists to create a graphical option to use the Henshin model transformations without the overhead of the heavy eclipse editor. A web-based graphical editor would make the use of Henshin even more accessible and intuitive.

  \ac{glsp} is a open-source framework by the Eclipse Foundation to develop custom diagram editors for distributed web-applications. \cite{glsp-repo} It can be used in Eclipse Desktop IDE, Eclipse Theia, Visual Studio Code and embedded in any website. With these fuctionalities, \ac{glsp} fits to create an accessible, intuitive application to create and apply Henshin model transformations.

  The goal of this scientific work is to provide relevant information about the used technologies and to research how they fit together to create a web-based model transformation editor.

  \label{subsec:henshin-glsp}

  \subsection{Indexing EMF models}
  \label{subsec:indexing}
  During the transformation of the source model into the graphical model, elements need to be accesed multible times. For example, a node is accesed from the \ac{emf} package when it is mapped into a \code{GNode} and then again for all its connedted edges and attributes. To avoid multible lookups in the \ac{emf} model, a index is created for each node, edge or attribute.

  \label{sec:conclusion}
