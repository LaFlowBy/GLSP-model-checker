  \section{Motivation and introduction}
  \label{sec:motivation}

  In software engineering, often \ac{mde} is used to increase development productivity and quality. Concepts are modeled closer to the domain, so that they describe important aspects of a solution with human-friendly abstractions. The models can also be used to generate application fragments, that can be directly used as source code. In the process of \ac{mde}, many activities need to transform source models into different target models, while following a set of transformation rules. This model transformation process is based on algebraic graph transformations. A metamodel is used to model the structure and rules of the concept. The resulting transformation language can provide automatic model creation, development and maintenance activities. \cite{transformations-modeldriven} One framework to use \ac{mde} is \ac{emf} by the Eclipse Foundation. It provides a basis for application development, using modeling and code generation facilities. Much frameworks build upon \ac{emf}, providing various \ac{mde} tools like code generators, graphical diagramming, model transformation or model validation. \cite{emf} One model transformation framework is Henshin. \cite{henshin-repo} It tries to provides model transformation capabilites with a high level of usability. \cite{henshin-usability} For metamodels it uses \ac{emf} Ecore files and for instance models \ac{emf} XMI files. The framework enables transformations on XMI instance files with a defined transformation language. It provides a graphical and textual syntax to create these transformation rules. \cite{henshin-repo} Henshin can be used as a eclipse plugin. Eclipse makes it easy to access, but especially for new users, the heavy editor makes the use of Henshin unintuitive.

  Therefore the goal exists to create a graphical option to use the Henshin model transformations without the overhead of the heavy eclipse editor. A web-based graphical editor would make the use of Henshin even more accessible and intuitive.

  \ac{glsp} is a open-source framework by the Eclipse Foundation to develop custom diagram editors for distributed web-applications. \cite{glsp-repo} It can be used in Eclipse Desktop IDE, Eclipse Theia, Visual Studio Code and embedded in any website. With these fuctionalities, \ac{glsp} fits to create an accessible, intuitive application to create and apply Henshin model transformations.

  \subsection{Requirements}
  \label{subsec:requirements}



  \subsection{Project Plan}
  \label{subsec:project-plan}
    When all requirements are realized, the application should be able to include every use case that you can also do in the Eclipse IDE with the Henshin plugin.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Create a viewer for \ac{emf} XMI instances
    \item Provide a posibility to display the transformation rules from a henshin file and apply them on the instance model with parameters
    \item Create a viewer for Henshin transformation rules.
    \item Provide editing functionality for transformation rules.
    \item Provide editing functionality for XMI instance models.
    \item Create a viewer for \ac{emf} Ecore metamodels.
    \item Provide editing functionality for Ecore metamodels.
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Implementation}
